### LAB Programs
- [ ] Write a C program for converting an Infix Expression to Postfix Expression.
- [ ] Design, Develop & Execute a program in C to evaluate a valid Postfix Expression using STACK.
Assume that the Postfix Expression is read as a single line consisting of non-negative single digit
operand and binary arithmetic operators. The arithmetic operators are (+), (-), (*) & (/)
