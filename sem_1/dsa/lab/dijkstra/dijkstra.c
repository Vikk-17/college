// From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other vertices using Dijkstar's algorithm.

/*
 Example:
  Output:
  Enter number of vettices: 5
  Enter the value of matrix
  0   3   999   7   999
  3   0   4     2   999
  999 4   0     5   6
  7   2   5     0   4
  999 999 6     4   0

  Enter the source of matrix: 1
  The shortest distance from 1 to 1 is = 0
  The shortest distance from 1 to 2 is = 3
  The shortest distance from 1 to 3 is = 7
  The shortest distance from 1 to 4 is = 5
  The shortest distance from 1 to 5 is = 9
